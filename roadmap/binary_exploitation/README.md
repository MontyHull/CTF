# Binary Exploitation Roadmap

This will be a basic list of differnt binary exploitation or pwn challenges from CTFs or CTF like websites. I will try to post them in an order of beginner, intermediate, and hard. Inside each difficulty setting I will try to list the challenges in an order such that the skills that are learned can build on one another. 

I will link to my saved code for each challenge, give a brief explantation of what type of vulnerabilty is present, what type of security is present and needs to be beaten, and what tools I used to arrive at an answer. An example would like:

[A CTF challenge](https://github.com/MontyHull/CTF/tree/master/roadmap/binary_exploitation)
- Basic ROP attack, calling different functions with paramaters
- NX enabled. No RELRO, PIE, or canaray present. 
- ropper, pwnbg, radare2

## Beginner 

[picoCTF 2018: buffer overflow 0](https://github.com/MontyHull/CTF/tree/master/picoCTF2018/binary/buffer_overflow_0)
- Basic buffer overflow. Overflow leads to win. 
- No security

[picoCTF 2018: buffer overflow 1](https://github.com/MontyHull/CTF/tree/master/picoCTF2018/binary/buffer_overflow_1)
- Buffer overflow, return to flag function. 
- No security
