Can you deal with the Duck Web? Get us the flag from this program [1] You can
also find the program in /problems/quackme_4_0e48834ea71b521b9f35d29dc7be974e

The problem that I'm most proud of solving so far is this one. I used ghidra to
reverse the binary given. Once inside I can find the do_magic() function. This
function takes the users input and a secret buffer and xor's them together. If
the user input is correct the output will be the original printed statement.
So to reverse this and find the flag you need to find the secret buffer and xor
that with the original printed message to get the flag.
