What does asm0(0x2a,0x4f) return? Submit the flag as a hexadecimal value
(starting with '0x'). NOTE: Your submission for this question will NOT be in
the normal flag format. Source [1]  located in the directory at
/problems/assembly-0_3_b7d6c21be1cefd3e53335a66e7815307

when you examine the source you see that you move ebp+0xC into ebx, and then
move ebx into eax. eax is what you are going to be returning, so you need to
figure out what is in ebx, which is ebp+0xC. ebp+0xC is 12 bytes from the base
pointer, which means that it should be the last argument passed into the
function. This is because you push the variables on from the end, so 0x4f is
pushed, then 0x2a is pushed, then the basepointer is pushed. so 0x2a is at
ebp+0x8 and ebp+0xC is 0x4f. 

Answer: 0x4f
