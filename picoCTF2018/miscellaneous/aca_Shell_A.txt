It's never a bad idea to brush up on those Linux skills or even learn some new
ones before you set off on this adventure! Connect with

This is your basic "learn some Linux" ctf question. In it you will need to
know how to traverse file directories using ls and cd, how to read, run,
delete, and copy files using cat, rm, and cp, how to print your username using
whoami, and how to print to the terminal using echo.. Below in order is the
commands you must type to complete the challenge. Some of the commands such
as cd or cat can be combined, but CTF shells can sometimes be very
particular about where a command is executed from. In this example you are
not allowed to copy in less you are in the home directory so I tried to keep
each command separate for readability and function.

Commands:
nc 2018shell.picoctf.com 6903
cd secrets
ls
rm *
echo 'Drop it in!'
cd ..
cd executables
./dontLookHere
whoami
cd ..
cp /tmp/TopSecret ./passwords/
cd passwords
cat TopSecret
