Can you utlize stdin, stdout, and stderr to get the flag from this program [1] ?
You can also find it in on the shell server at
/problems/in-out-error_0_0f875f7714b995dad5946a15be6267a7

when you get to the directory given you have a flag.txt and an exe. Once you run
the program it asks you to type a sentence for the flag from stdin. If you do it
will flood you with a ton of garbled text. If you instead pipe the sentence in
and then redirect stdout to /dev/null you will get the actual answer. Also, if
you redirect stderr to /dev/null you will get rick rolled.
