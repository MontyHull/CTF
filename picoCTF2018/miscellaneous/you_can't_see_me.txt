To solve this you will need to navigate to the above given dir. Once there You
will notice that it is empty. however, if you ls -a (I prefer ls -la) you will
see that there is a file . in the directory. Since there is also a directory .
you can't just cat . so you need to escape it with cat ./ / you can also just
use cat then hit tab and it will autofill the file name for you.
