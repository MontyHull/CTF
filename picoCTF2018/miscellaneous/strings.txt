Can you find the flag in this file [1]  without actually running it?
You can also find the file in
/problems/strings_3_1dbaafa1f8f0556872cad33e16bc8dc7 on the shell server.

For this problem you will download a file called strings that is loaded with
strings and raw data. If you change the permissions on it and run it, it will
print "Have you ever used the 'strings' function? Check out the man pages!"
If you then run strings on it it will print all of the strings that the program
contains, which is a lot. You can save that to a file and try to read through
it, or you can just grep the output for picoCTF to find the answer. 

command: strings strings | grep "picoCTF"

answer: picoCTF{sTrIngS_sAVeS_Time_2fbe2166}
