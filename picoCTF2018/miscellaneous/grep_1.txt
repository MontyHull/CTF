Can you find the flag in file [1] ? This would be really obnoxious to look
through by hand, see if you can find a faster way. You can also find the file
in /problems/grep-1_0_c0c0c16438cdbee39591397e16389f59 on the shell server.

the file that you download is full of random data. To find the flag you
should use the grep command. If you cat the file and then pipe that into the
grep command with "picoCTF" as the option.

command: cat file | grep "picoCTF"

answer: picoCTF{grep_and_you_will_find_52e63a9f}
