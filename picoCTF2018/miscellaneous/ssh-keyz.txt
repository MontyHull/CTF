As nice as it is to use our webshell, sometimes its helpful to connect directly
to our machine. To do so, please add your own public key to
~/.ssh/authorized_keys, using the webshell. The flag is in the ssh banner which
will be displayed when you login remotely with ssh to  with your username.

For this challenge you are going to generate two ssh keys, your public and
private keys. Once you generate them add your private to your ssh-agent. then
copy your public one and copy it to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys as text file. I
used $echo 'my_public_key' > pubkey.pub  in order to make the file. Then from
your computer ssh into the shell and the login banner will give you the flag.

command: ssh username@2018shell.picoctf.com
