Using a debugging tool will be extremely useful on your missions. Can you run
this program [1]  in gdb and find the flag? You can find the file in
/problems/learn-gdb_2_32e08c18932eb88649e9b97f3020b9f5 on the shell server.

When you get to the directory there is only a single file called run. If you
run it it will run through it's code then exit without giving you anything.
If you look through the source using a dump or strings or a number of other
tools you will notice that there is a function called decrypt_flag. if you put
a break on the function and run the program you enter it. Then finish the
function. Once you return to main you will see that it told you that it
had saved everything to a global variable called flag_buf. If you type
printf "%s", (char*) flag_buf it will look at that variable and print it for you
