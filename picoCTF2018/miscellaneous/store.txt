For this problem you are trying to find a number large enough that you will flip
from positive numbers to negatives since it is getting read in as two's
complement. If you start with 10 and continue to double your 0's you will
eventually get there. Once it flips and you have a negative number your bank
account increases instead of decreases and you then have enough money to buy the
flag.
