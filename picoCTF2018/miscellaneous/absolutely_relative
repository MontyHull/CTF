In a filesystem, everything is relative ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Can you find a way to get a
flag from this program [1] ? You can find it in
/problems/absolutely-relative_0_d4f0f1c47f503378c4bb81981a80a9b6 on the shell
server. Source [2] .

When you get to the directory for the flag there are three files present.
One is the flag.txt which you don't have permission to read. The second is
a program called absolutely_relative and the third is it's source. If you run
the code it will tell you that you don't have permission to read the file.
If you then look in the source you will see that it is checking a file
./permission.txt for the word yes to see if you have permission. However, you
don't have permission to write in the current folder, so you have to create the
file in your home dir, then run the program from there. Because it is looking
for the file using a relative path it will look in your home dir and run.
