Sometimes you have to configure environment variables before executing a
program. Can you find the flag we've hidden in an environment variable on the
shell server?

For this challenge you need to login to the game's server and run the command
env. This will print out all of your default environment settings, and your flag
will be located at the top of the output.

command: env

answer: SECRET_FLAG=picoCTF{eNv1r0nM3nT_v4r14Bl3_fL4g_3758492}
