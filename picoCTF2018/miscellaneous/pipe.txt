During your adventure, you will likely encounter a situation where you need to
process data that you receive over the network rather than through a file.
Can you find a way to save the output from this program and search for the flag?
Connect with 2018shell.picoctf.com 34532.

For this problem you are going to be using nc, grep, and pipes " | ". If you
attempt to just run "nc 2018shell.picoctf.com 34532" then you are going to be
flooded with messages that you aren't going to be able to read fast enough to
find the flag. However, if you attach the grep command to it with picoCTF then
you will only print the answer.  

command nc 2018shell.picoctf.com 34532 | grep "picoCTF"

answer: picoCTF{almost_like_mario_b797f2b3}
