This one is a little bit harder. Can you find the flag in
/problems/grep-2_4_06c2058761f24267033e7ca6ff9d9144/files
on the shell server? Remember, grep is your friend.

This challenge asks you to grep through many files and folders to find the flag.
The way to do this is to attach the -r option to your grep command. This will
tell grep to recursively search through each file and directory starting with
your current directory and going until there are no more children nodes.

command: grep -r "picoCTF"

answer: files2/file8:picoCTF{grep_r_and_you_will_find_036bbb25}
