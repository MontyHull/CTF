This program prints any input you give it. Can you leak [1]  the flag?
Connect with nc 2018shell.picoctf.com 46960. Source [2] .

When you look at the source you can see that they are using printf to
print out exactly what you give them without using your input as a string,
which allows you to input modifiers. The easiest way to do this is to just
use %#08x. to find addresses to attempt to print with %s. Once you find an
address just use %s to see if it's a string, and eventually you will be able to
find the flag. 

Command: %#08x.%#08x.%#08x.%#08x.%#08x.%#08x.%#08x.%s
