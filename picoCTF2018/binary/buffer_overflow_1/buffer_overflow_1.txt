Okay now you're cooking! This time can you overflow the buffer and return to
the flag function in this program [1] ? You can find it in
/problems/buffer-overflow-1_2_86cbe4de3cdc8986063c379e61f669ba
on the shell server. Source [2] .

For this problem you need to get to address 0x080485cb in order to get into the
function win() and have the flag print. To do this you have to overwrite the
return address in the vuln() function. When you look at the vuln() function you
see that the buffer has a size of 32 bytes. You need to add 4 more for your ebp,
4 more for your esp, and four more for something that I don't know. Therefore
you need to write 44 bytes to the buffer, then 4 more for the address you are
trying to get to. the command is listed below.

Command: python -c "print('\x41'*44 + '\xcb\x85\x04\x08')" | ./vuln
