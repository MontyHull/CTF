This program [1]  executes any input you give it. Can you get a shell? You can
find the program in /problems/shellcode_1_cec2eb801137d645a9f15b9b6af5347a
on the shell server. Source [2] .

To figure this one out you just need to execute some shellcode and continue
running so if you put your code in a file and then redirect your file into vuln
using cat and - to continue running you will get control of a shell.

Command: cat ~/code.txt - | ./vuln
