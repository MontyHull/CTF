This program [1]  gives you the address of some system calls. Can you get a
shell? You can find the program in
/problems/got-2-learn-libc_1_ceda86bc09ce7d6a0588da4f914eb833
on the shell server. Source [2] .

To get this one you need to find the address of the system call in libc, then
call it with the argument saved in useful string. To do this you need to find
the offset between puts (or any of the other libc calls) and system. Then you
need to calculate the address based off of the offset and then buffer overflow
to that address then use the address of the given string which is for a shell.
I used pwntools and created a script to do most of this for me.
