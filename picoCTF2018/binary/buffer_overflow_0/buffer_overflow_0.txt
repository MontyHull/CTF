Let's start off simple, can you overflow the right buffer in this program [1]
to get the flag? You can also find it in
/problems/buffer-overflow-0_1_316c391426b9319fbdfb523ee15b37db
on the shell server. Source [2] .

This program sets up a signal handler for segfaults to print the flag, so you
just need to overflow the buffer and it will print the flag for you.
